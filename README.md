This is a mini e-commerce web app. Here I used only front-end.
There you can see a button "Admin Client," which I use to toggle between admin and client pages.<br><br><br>
On the admin page, you can:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- add new products<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- edit products<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- delete products<br><br><br>
On the client page, you can:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- add products to a cart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- view products inside of the cart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- delete products from the cart<br><br>
Also, **notice what happens when you go back and forth in the history by using the browser's arrows.**<br><br>
